# Analyzing intentional walks in Major League Baseball batting data

This is a project I put together in Fall 2016 as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

It uses batting data from Sean Lahman's Baseball Database up through 2015. The current version of the database can be found at http://seanlahman.com/
